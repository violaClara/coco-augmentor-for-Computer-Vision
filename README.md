## ✨ Features

* **Web Interface (GUI):** No coding needed for end-users. Just upload and click.
* **Dual Support:** Handles both **Bounding Boxes** (Object Detection) and **Segmentation Polygons** (Instance Segmentation).
* **SAM2 Compatible:** fixes common issues with SAM2 output (e.g., handling empty/invalid polygons).
* **Smart Path Detection:** Automatically finds images inside the ZIP even if the JSON paths don't match the folder structure.
* **Stacked Augmentations:**
    * ↔️ Flip Horizontal
    * ↕️ Flip Vertical
    * 🔄 **Rotation Modes:**
        * **Fixed:** Rotate by a specific degree (e.g., exactly 90°).
        * **Random:** Rotate randomly within a limit (e.g., -45° to +45°).
